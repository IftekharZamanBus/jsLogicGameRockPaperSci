# jsLogicGameRockPaperSci

## Overview
This is a solely HTML and JavaScript based project, without any CSS because this was used to just practice my base-line JavaScript skills. It's a fun game where, there will be 3 options which are, rock, paper, or scizzors. Depending on which one you click the computer will click a randomly generated one that is between rock, paper, or scizzors. It will keep a score count based on who wins. Rock beats Scizzors, Scizzors beats Paper, and Paper beats rock, etc.

### Technology Stack
These are the technologies I used to make this project to what it is today.

- **HTML**

- **JavaScript**

### Functionality (JavaScript)
This project incorporates several JavaScript functions, below are many of the key func tions needed for this project to work.

- **game() - sets everything to 0 such as the 'playerScore, computerScore, and amount of moves left'.**

- **playGame() - When you click one of the buttons that are labeled rock, paper, or scizzor, the game will automatically start.**

- **winner() - When you click a character a winner will be announced for just that round, once all the moves and turns are over, the winner will be the person with the most wins within the rounds.**

- **gameOver() - "Game Over!" is displayed when you ultimately lose the whole tournament.**

### Styling and Layout
There was no styling and layout for this section.

### Project Structure
These are all the files I used and why I used them.

- **index.html - I used this to setup all the words and letters you see on the screen before the game starts**

- **app.js - I used this to create all the functions that actually make the frontend work correctly such as whenever I click a button it does something in the game**
